Controls
========

 * To control the game player should stand up facing towards the DK2 motion tracker camera.
 * Camera should be placed about 1-2 meters in front of the player on the eye level height.
 * Using tripod is recommended.
 * Slow movements can be achieved by making small steps inside the in game marked tracker range.
 * Faster movements achieved by jogging in place. Steps are detected using head movements so it is better to jog hopping. It takes a bit to of practice to figure out the comfortable jogging style.
